## Signing Up

### Sign up with Google

If you have a Google account associated with your company email address, it is recommended you select **Sign up with Google** and authorize the application with your Google account.

### Sign up with Email

If you do not have a Google account associated with your company email address, enter your company email and a secure password and click **Sign Up**.

You'll receive an email asking you to verify your email address. Once you verified your email address you can move forward in the application.

## Organizations

### Create an Organization

If you're signing in for the first time and do not have any invitations to an Organization, you'll need to create a new Organization.

Organizations are logic groupings of **People** and **Workspaces**. They are often synonymous with _Companies_, but there are reasons for a single company to have multiple Organizations.

### Join an Organization

If you have been invited to an Organization by another user, you will see a list of invitations after you sign in. Click **Join** next to each Organization you wish to join.

## Signing In

If your account is associated with a Google account, click **Sign in with Google** - a browser tab will open up asking you to choose the Google account associated with your company email address.

If your account is associated with an email address and password, enter your company email address and your password and click **Sign In**.

## Inviting Team Members

You can **invite** your colleagues to your Organization by clicking the Envelope in the menu on the left. Choose your Organization, enter your colleague's email address and hit Send.
They will receive an invite welcoming them to Deep Channel. When they sign in the first time they will be prompted to accept your invite.
