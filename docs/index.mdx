## What is Deep Channel?

Deep Channel is a streamlined workspace to analyze, transform, and test data using data warehouses and <DbtCoreR />. 

Deep Channel combines the database connectivity of a SQL IDE with an advanced dbt project editor to deliver an unparalleled development experience with real time error reporting, error linting, and autocomplete. 

## What makes Deep Channel different?

Today, data professionals spend their day jumping between disconnected tools like SQL IDEs, text editors, and command line programs.

Using Deep Channel, data professionals spend less time jumping between disconnected tools and more time doing deep, focused analytics work.

Here are just a few of the ways Deep Channel improves workflows:
* A desktop app gives powerful keyboard shortcuts, OS notifications, fast project compilation and error notifications, and quick access in the Dock/taskbar
* <DbtCoreR /> runs directly in the app, providing lightening fast compilation of your dbt models
* Advanced autocomplete suggestions for SQL and Jinja syntax
* Real time error reporting for invalid model syntax and unrecognized columns
* Column level awareness in dbt projects powering features like Go to Definition, Peek Definition, and hovering over a relation to see its schema
* Quickly view the lineage of a model, its compiled SQL, or a preview of the model's results
* A robust dbt Command bar that suggests commands, models, file locations, packages and more

## Security
Your data and credentials stay between you and your data warehouse. We do not collect any data about your data warehouse, dbt Project, or credentials.
