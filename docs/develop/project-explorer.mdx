# Project Explorer


Click the **Explorer** menu item or press <Keybinding mac="⇧ ⌘ E" winux="ctrl+shift+e" /> to open the Project Explorer and view your <DbtCoreR /> Project.

The Project Explorer looks and feels like a file tree explorer you're used to and has the same functionality: click to open a file, expand and collapse folders, drag files around, and rename or delete files.
